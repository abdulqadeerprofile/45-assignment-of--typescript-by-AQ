//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the 
// beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", 
//at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
// Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

let my_name : string = "My name is \t Abdul Qadeer \n and i am enrolled in Governer Initiative Program karachi"
console.log(my_name);
